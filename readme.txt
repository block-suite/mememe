Turn your regular images into memes.

== Description ==
Making memes is hard. You have to use Photoshop, find the right font, ugh. And if you think of something better you have to start the process all over again.

There has to be a better way. There is, it's Meme Me. Meme Me adds a custom meme style to the core image block. Just select the style, add your caption and you have a meme that will impress all your friends.

#### Customization
Meme Me offers a few customizations options:

* **Placement:** You can control if you want your text at the top or bottom of the image.
* **Font Size:** You're in control, make your caption as big or small as you like.

#### I like this, who made it?
This plugin is brought to you by [sorta brilliant](https://sortabrilliant.com/) and [block garden](https://block.garden).
